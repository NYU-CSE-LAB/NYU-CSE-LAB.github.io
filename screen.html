        <p>Before you start, make sure you know how to SSH to the server. Learn about that <a href="ssh.html">here</a>.</p>

                <note>If you are home (read: not connected to NYU wifi) you have to use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nyu.edu/life/information-technology/getting-started/network-and-connectivity/vpn.html">NYU VPN</a>). Scroll down the page to see the download link for the vpn client for your platform (Windows, Mac etc.). When the vpn client asks for the server address use vpn.nyu.edu and use your typical netid and password to authenticate.</note>

        <p>Nohup deserves a mention because it is extremely simple to use and can turn any bash command into a daemon. It even writes outputs from commands to a file.</p>
        <p><code>nohup shell-command &</code></p>
        <p>Lets see an example:</p>
